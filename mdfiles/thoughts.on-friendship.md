Someone once told me, according to their definition of a friend, they have none. The definition - or description rather (paraphrased) was ‘someone you can talk to about anything, someone who knows what is going on in your life, someone who you turn to when you need something’. Presumably, the feelings would have to be somewhat mutual, or else teachers and mentors fit the description.

The description also seems to fit what’s called a قرين in the Quran.

> إني كان لي قرين 
>  - *surah sāffāt*

The speaker then goes on to say that were it not for the grace of his Lord, he would have been ruined by this friend. It should be noted, the speaker is in paradise whilst he says this. 

But it’s not all doom and gloom. A *qarīn* can be good. In fact, Abu bakr and Umar (may God be pleased with them) were called the *two ‘qarīns’* (lit. القرينان). If that is not high enough, the example of *Jibrīl* and our prophet ﷺ will suffice.

We live in a time where deep intimate friendships are rare, and maybe that’s a good thing. Pray that we have the company of the angelic, and separation from the demonic.
