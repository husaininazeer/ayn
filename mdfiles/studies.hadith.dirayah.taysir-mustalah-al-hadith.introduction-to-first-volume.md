﷽

All praise belongs to God who blessed muslims with the revelation of the
Qur’ān, ensured its preservation in the chests \[of men\] and in the
lines \[of paper\] till the day of judgement, and made from the best of
its preservation the preservation of the *Sunnah* of the master of the
messengers.

May the salutations and peace \[of God\] be upon our master, our prophet
Muḥammad. The one whom God entrusted the clarification of what He
intended from the revelation. As He says “We have revealed to you the
reminder to clarify to the people what was sent down to them so that
they may ponder”. So he \[may God’s peace and blessings be upon him\] is
a clarifier for the Qur’ān through his statements, actions, approvals,
through clear and apparent means.

May God be pleased with the companions who transmitted the prophetic
*Sunnah* from the noble prophet \[may God’s peace and blessings be upon
him\]. They committed it to memory and related it to the muslims as they
heard it, free from the defects of alterations and substitutions

May God’s vast mercy and forgiveness be upon the righteous predecessors
who transmitted the pure *Sunnah*, generation through generation, and
compiled minute principles and rules for its sound transmission, free
from the alterations of liars.

May God reward with the best those that succeeded the predecessors from
amongst the scholars of muslims. Those who transmitted the principles
and rules of narration of the *Sunnah* from the predecessors; refining
it, ordering it, and compiling it independent literature naming the it
"the science of *Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadịth*".

As for what follows. A couple of years ago, when I was made responsible
to teach *Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadịth* in the faculty of *Sharī’ah* in the
university of Madinah، what was established was the teaching of “‘Ulūm
al-Ḥadīth” by *Imām ibn Ṣalāḥ*, then the university set its summary
“at-Taqrīb” by *Imām an-Nawawī*, I found with the students some
difficulties in teaching these two books; due to their greatness، and
abundant of benefit - a methodical study. From amongst the difficulties
are:

- the \[excessive\] length of some discussions (in particular in *Imām ibn Ṣalāḥ* ’s book)
- the shortening in some later discussions (in particular in *Imām an-Nawawī* ’s book) 
- the difficulties of phrases \[used\]
- the lack of completion of some discussions like the omissions:
  - of some definitions
  - of examples
  - of mentioning the benefits of these discussions
  - of mentioning the famous literary work

I also found, other books from the early generations of this science to
be like that. In fact, some of these books are not comprehensive \[and
do not cover\] all of the science of *Ḥadịth*, and some of the are not
refined, nor are they ordered. Their reason for this is either due to
them leaving matters which are obvious to them, or due to the necessity
of the length of some topics with respect to their times. Or it could be
due to other reasons that we may or may not know.

So I thought to give the students of the faculty of *Sharī’ah* an easy
book on the technicalities of *Ḥadịth* and its sciences - to make
understanding the principles and the technicalities of this science easy
for them. This is by splitting every topic into continuous numbered
sections: beginning with its definition, its example, its types, ending
with a section on famous works on the topic. All of this is in simple
wording and clear pedagogy without complications or obscurity. I also do
not go into most of the differences, statements, and detailed treatments
of issues, taking into consideration the short lesson times
(specifically in this faculty and) in \[other\] Islamic science
faculties.

I have named it “Taysīr Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadịth”. I do not see this book
having no need for the works of the early scholars of this science. I
only intend that it \[my book\] be an opener to them, a reminder of what
is contained within them, and making accessible true understanding of
them. The works of the Imāms and scholars of the early generations
continue to remain a point of reference for the scholars and specialists
of this science. \[These works are\] helpful, overflowing with bounty
such that they drink from it.

It does not escape me that I should mention - there have been books
published by researchers in recent times which are of great benefit,
especially in refuting the doubts of orientalists and those who
misconstrue. However, some of these books are long, some are \[too\]
short, and some are comprehensive. So I wished that my book be balanced - in-between the too long and too short, containing all topics.

What is new in my book is the following:

1. Sectioning - i.e. splitting every topic into numbered sections, so that it is easy for the student to understand
1. Completion in every topic - with respect to the general framework of the topic (i.e. the definition, examples, etc..)
1. Encompassing all of the topics of *Muṣṭalaḥ* as much as possible with resemblance to a summary work.

As for the chapter headings and ordering, I have used *al-Ḥāfiẓ ibn
Ḥajar* \[may God have mercy on him\] methodology in *an-Nukhbah* and
its explanation, as it is the best ordering to gain access to it \[the
science\]. The majority of my dependence in subject matter is from
“‘Ulūm al-Ḥadīth” by *Imām ibn Ṣalāḥ*, its summary “at-Taqrīb” by
*Imām an-Nawawī*, and it’s explanation “at-Tadrīb” by *Imām as-Suyūṭī*
\[may God be pleased with them all\].

I have place in this book an introduction and 4 chapters:

1. on reports
1. on criticising and praising
1. on narration (*Rewāyah*) and its foundations
1. on the chains of transmission (*Isnād*) and knowledge of the narrators

I present this modest effort for our children - the students, whilst I
know my weakness and shortcoming in giving this science its right. And I
do not free my self from mistakes and errors. So I hope that the one who
finds in it a mistake or an error points it out to me - \[with much
gratitude\] so that I may correct it. I hope \[and pray to\] God, \[He\]
benefits the students with it, and those who work in *Ḥadịth*, and that
He makes \[this work\] purely for \[seeking\] His Noble Face.

Surely, glorified is He, All-Hearing, Supreme Answerer of all
Supplication.
