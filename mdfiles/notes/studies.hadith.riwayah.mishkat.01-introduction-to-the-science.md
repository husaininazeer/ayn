## Where did the discipline of ḥadīth emerge from? Why?

- events (the statements, actions, (dis/)approvals of the beloved ﷺ that the companions remember
    - narrate to each other (even during the lifetime of the beloved ﷺ)
- intertextuality - the messenger ﷺ is the message
    - the message can not be understood without the messenger ﷺ
    - >  كان خلقه القرآن
    - ergo a natural need to preserve, compile, and collate ḥadīth


### How was ḥadīth preserved in the first generation?

- by (strong) memory - a generally illiterate society
- no attempts to compile into literature
- not every companion was present with the messenger ﷺ at all times
    - ergo no one companion knew **all** of the sunnah
    - but the sunnah was preserved by companions collectively

### How was ḥadīth preserved in the second generation?

- at the passing of the messenger ﷺ the door to companionship of the messenger was closed
    - but the companions knew the *tābi’ūn*
- the *tābi’ūn* collated knowledge (either specific subjects, or general) from the companions
    - e.g. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar stating Sa’īd ibn al-Muṣayyib knows more about the battle of badr than himself
        - the companions were not intending to collect information on incidents
        - irregularities in recalling memories can arise - *tābi’ūn* corrected them by collecting information from multiple sources and weed them out


### How was ḥadīth preserved in the third generation?

- due to political reasons (against the umayyads), there is an increase of fabrications
    - this gives rise to the need for Isnād
    - > هاتوا برجالكم - محمد بن سيرين
    - > الإسناد من الدين ولولا الإسناد لقال من شاء ما شاء - عبد الله بن مبارك
    - knowledge without a sanad is just like an abandoned glass of milk
        - knowledge must be traceable
- N.B. the *tābi’ūn* was a scholarly class (i.e. they have to take knowledge from the companions) rather than a generation
    - Imām al-A’ẓam was probably a minor tābi’ī


## questions

- who was the student of aisha whom she had much care for and ask about when he was missing?
