﷽


What you may or may not see:

* notes [^1] (both technical and uloomi)
* musings
* poetry

I figure this would be a nice time capsule for me to look back at and be grateful for. To see myself hopefully being lifted away from the darkness and into the light.

I was inspired to do this after seeing a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darsdiary), but felt Twitter is too noisy for this kind of content. Ergo, ayn.

All feedback is much appreciated.

### Why the name ع and how?

* The name of first dictionary in Arabic (written by the al-Khalil)
* To know - علم - يعلم - a word that begins with ع
- The sheer number of meanings this one word carries


I built ayn writing in [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) markdown, to allow for easy conversion into html. Then a couple of shell scripts later, I deployed.
