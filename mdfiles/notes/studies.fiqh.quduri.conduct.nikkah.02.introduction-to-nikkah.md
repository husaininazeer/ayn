> فانكحوا ما طاب لكم من النساء - النساء ٣

> وأنكحوا الأيمى منكم - النور ٣٢

> تناكحوا تكاثروا… - أبي داود

> النكاح من سنتي، فمن رغب عن سنتي فليس مني - البخاري ومسلم

  - the above is taken from الإختيار
  - a command from God and His messenger ﷺ, but for encouragement
  - not intrinsically an act of worship
  - there is consensus for the legal basis for marriage
  - reasoning dictates:
      - humans have desire, need society
      - marriage preserves humanity (’s wealth, religion, society)

## What are the legal causes (علة) for marriage?

- mentioned in Kamāl ad-Dirāyah sharh Multaqa al-Abḥur by Muhammad ibn Walī al-Izmīrī (d. 1165).
  - Multaqa al-Abḥur is a meta-matn that combines the 4 core primers.
      - written by Ibrāhīm al-Ḥalabī (d. 956)
          - Know thy Ibrāhīm al-Ḥalabī (there are 2)
  - al-Izmīrī writes 
      - a super-commentary on Usūl
      - commentary on Ḥizb al-Barr of Imam ash-Shādhilī

1.  Active cause (علة فاعلية) - requires 2 parties
2.  Tangible cause (علة مادّية) - offer and acceptance
3.  Apparent cause (علة سورية) - coming together of the 2 parties with
    the offer and acceptance - in a legally recognised way
4.  Ultimate cause (علة غائية) - right of physical fulfilment (not only
    physical, e.g. emotional, spiritual)

## What are the legal rulings on marriage?

  - General rulings aren’t always applicable
  - Shafii: recommended Sunnah
  - Hanafi: emphasized Sunnah
      - as mentioned in:
          - ad-Durr al-Mukhtār - Haṣkafī (d. 1088)
          - Radd - Ibn ‘Ābidīn (d. 1252)
              - > لولا ابن عابدين ما فهمنا الدين
      - conditions:
          - does not fear wrongdoing their spouse (even if they have
            strong desire)
          - has the ability to fulfil the expectations of marriage
              - husband: financial
              - both: sexual
  - but it can take all 5 rulings:
      - obligatory - واجب:
          - strong desire to marry (واجب عند التوقال)
          - genuine fear from unlawful sexual acts (fornication,
            masturbation, etc…)
      - emphasised sunnah - سنة مؤكدة:
          - general ruling
              - Umar ibn Nujaym’s view : it’s obligatory
                  - weak view
          - able to fulfil the rights and responsibilities
          - man able to give mahr, even if by borrowing
          - intend it as ibādah
          - thus blameworthy (فيه إسائة) if conditions are met and one
            does not marry without good reason
      - permissible:
          - no desire to marry
          - but praiseworthy
      - disliked:
          - when one has general but reasonable fear for wrongdoing
      - prohibitively disliked:
          - when one has reasonable surety for wrongdoing
              - even if there is fear of falling into licentiousness

## What are the recommendations of marriage?

  - marrying young **when able to**
  - borrowing to marry (if needed)
      - lending (not paying) for someone else to marry is thus a
        recommended too
  - raising children that are ready for marriage when the time comes
  - simple not lavish
  - reasonable mahr
