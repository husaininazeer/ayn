## Introduction

- Imam Ghazālī [Allah have mercy on his soul, hereafter referred to as Imam] gets a letter [presumably from his student] asking him
    - the aims of sciences
    - difficulties getting from a stage of *taqlīd* to “first hand” belief
    - what he approves of/disapproves of from:
        - Kalām
        - philosophy
        - taṣawwuf
        - taqlīd
- he’s always been inquisitive - from a young age trying to understand
    - the philosophy of the philosophers
    - the taṣawwuf of the ṣūfīs
    - the heresy or the heretics etc
- all these groups claim to have the truth
    - but he realised knowledge of something is what he is *absolutely* certain on
        - i.e. regardless of the claim to dispute the knowledge, it should still stand, unshaken
        - the mind can not comprehend otherwise
            - e.g. 3<10
            - regardless of whoever says it ain’t so, it will always be true
- imam realises that everything he knows (with certainty) is based on the authority of someone else
    - except his senses and necessary truths (e.g. 3<10)
    - but even his senses are not accurate
        - eyes see the sundial’s shadow as still, but an hour passes and it has moved
            - so it’s moving but your eyes see it as still
        - eyes see the sun as small, but from rational calculations we know it to be bigger than earth
    - his idea of first principles relies on his rationality
        - but in dreams your rationality believes the things you see to be true until you awaken
            - maybe there is a another state where your intellect will be shown to be false too (just like the state the sufis claim to be in)
- this means nothing he knows, he can be certain on
    - to get rid of problems like this, you need to demonstrate
    - to demonstrate, you need first principles - tough, you don’t have them now because you aren’t certain of them
    - he says eventually the only thing that cure him was Allah The Most High
    - what is sought should be sought after - but you should stop before what is not sought after
        - first principles are not sought after - they are at present and at hand
        - if you seek that which is present, it becomes hidden

## The different classes of seekers [of truth]

- all of the following claim to seek the truth
    - *mutakallimūn* - theologians
    - *Bāṭiniyyah*
    - philosophers
    - *ṣūfīs* - mystics

### *Kalām*

- *Kalām’s* aim: preserve the creed of orthodoxy and defend against deviations of heretics
    - heretics “almost corrupted the creed”
        - Allah The Most High sent theologians who defended orthodoxy with ‘systematic arguments’
            - but their premises were taken from their opponents
            - and they’d take it to their logical conclusions
                - to show the contradictions in claims of heretics
    - this does not help with Imam’s problem
    - Imam accepts that the science could be sufficient for others (just not himself)
        - one man’s medicine is another man’s poison

### Philosophy

- to find defects in any other science, you need mastery in philosophy
- so imam spends 2 years mastering philosophy [whilst teaching 300 students in Baghdād]
- there are three schools of Philosophy:
    - Materialists: الدهريون
        - deny the existence of The Creator
        - consider the world to be not change (it was how it is, and it will be how it is)
    - Naturalists: الطبيعيون
        - [these do the empirical research] and see the creation of The Creator and affirm His existence
        - but they reject the last day and everything surrounding it
            - once we die, we die and we can not be resurrected
    - Theists: الإلهيون
        - This is where Socrates -> Plato -> Aristotle are
            - Aristotle systematised logic and distanced himself from the two previous groups [and his 2 teachers]
                - but he had residue of the disbelief
                - Imam says al-Farābi and ibn Sīna also fall into this group!!
                    - but he says no one has accomplished as much as them
- So philosophy can take 3 rulings:
    - disbelief
    - heresy
    - not to be denied
- branches of philosophy are six:
    - Mathematics
    - Logic
    - Natural sciences
    - Theology
    - Politics
    - Ethics

##### Mathematics

- proof [that has no religious significance] which once understood can not be denied
    - drawbacks (2):
        - just because the proofs of maths are precise does not mean the philosophers are as precise in other sciences
            - so the student will take them as authorities and say ‘if they reject, it must be true. they were precise in maths, they must be precise in everything else too’
            - the response is: a master in one field could be ignorant in others - every science has its people
        - the one who blindly rejects maths (because of its association with philosophy - the philosophers are deviants, so must the mathematicians!)
            - so when mathematical proof is shown to him, he denies and thinks Islām to be defended by that [ignorant] denial

##### Logic

- there is nothing here that needs to be rejected
- logic looks at taṣawwur, taṣdīq (conceptualisation of a topic and affirmation of statements), creating sound definitions and syllogistic arguments
- drawbacks:
    - the logician look a the one who rejects it and wonder about his intelligence!
    - the student of logic has high standards of proof and has to relax that standard in religious questions


##### Natural sciences or Physics

- the subject matter is looking at heavenly bodies or living matter on earth
    - there is nothing here that needs to be rejected except:
        - everything that dictates activity is produced from the essence of something [it is not, it is under the control of Allah The Most High who is sustaining it]

##### Theology

- there are 20 points of error
    - 17 are heresy
    - 3 are disbelief:
        - rejecting the body being punished or rewarded in the hereafter [they say it is just spirits]
        - claiming that ‘God knows universals, not particulars’ [Imam quotes from *Sūrah Fāṭir* to disprove this]
        - claiming the world is everlasting - no muslim claims this
    - imam mentions 1 more:
        - that God by His Essence knows [*Ahl as-Sunnah* believe that His knowledge is over and above His Essence - see notes on types of attributes in Kharīdah]

##### Politics

- similar to logic, nothing to reject here
    - all taken from saints or wisdom prophets of old

##### Ethics

- most of is taken from the people of *taṣawwuf*
    - its dangers are two:
        - blind rejection without considering the claims for what they are (independent of the one making the claim)
            - so Imam insists that it should be closed to the public - as the layman has no idea how to discern true from false
        - forming a good opinion of them based on some of the things a person finds to be true
            - e.g. sayings of prophets, mystics etc
            - you must ascertain each claim for itself, independent of all other claims made by the ethicist
    - due to the dangers, Imam recommends only the ‘Ulamā’ proceed and others abstain [he gives many analogies for this and the adab with regards to approaching this science]


## The *Bāṭiniyyah* and the *Ṣūfīs*

It is well-worth reading the text itself for the section on the *Ṣūfīs* - I think it to be a disservice to summarise it, and it is hard to overstate how important it is. However, I found the section on *Bāṭiniyyah* not particularly relevant - but nice to see discourse from Imam *Ghazālī*.

May Allah have mercy on his soul.
