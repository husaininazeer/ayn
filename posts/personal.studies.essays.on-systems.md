By systems, I mean a set of instructions that if followed, allow one to achieve the desired end result in a more efficient manner. I can not think of component of my life that does not have a system. Maybe relationships, but that's a can of worms that should not be opened on the internet. Note-taking? Sure, Vim to text edit, alternate between using my own bash scripts, and using [dendron](htpps://www.dendron.so/). Qur\'an memorisation? Every Muslim nation has it's own flavour! The subcontinent method (having 3 concurrent components that should be catered to: the *sabaq*, *sabaq juz*, and the *dhor*). For the poor confused Arab/non-Desi, the new hifdh, the recent hifdh (also known as *murāji\'ah*), the old hifdh (revision or *wird*). I hear that the Egyptians (God bless them) place less of an imporance on the latter, but instead focus on getting the student to complete multiple *khatms* as quick as possible.

The system that I am most pleased of inventing (inventing is a stretch) is the system that I used to capture the *usūl* and *furūsh* for my *sab\'ah* and *\'ashrah* *qirā'āt* class. Principles are in red, exceptions in blue. I'd have the difference written in black. A red circle is a sign to read with an *imālah*. A hollow red circle for *taqlīl*. This worked really well for the last two years or so.

But the fulcrum underlying all of the above systems? Consistency. Consistently recording the things that I learn, or logging bugs using note-taking systems. Consitently using vim, so it is burned into my muscle memory. Consistently showing up to class to get through the three-part hifdh system. Consistently doing *tahqīq* even in small amounts. Especially in small amounts.

The point I am trying to get across here (if not obvious already): Most systems work. They just need you to show up consistently.

To put it more beautifully:
